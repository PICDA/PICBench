Problem Description-Spanke_4x4:

Design an NxN optical switching network based on the Spanke architecture, ensuring strict-sense non-blocking switching between N input and N output ports. The network should use 2N x (N-1) built-in Multimode Interferometer (MMI) components and consist of a combination of N 1xN switches and N Nx1 switches. 

 Parameters:N=4
