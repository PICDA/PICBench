Problem Description-MZI_ps:

Create a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with a single input and output, featuring a path length difference of ΔL. A phase shifters with a length of L should be applied to the top arm to modulate the phase of the optical signal. Use the built-in multimode interferometer (MMI) component for splitting and combining the optical signals, and the built-in phase shifters to achieve the desired phase modulation. 

Parameters:
ΔL=10 microns 
L=10 microns
