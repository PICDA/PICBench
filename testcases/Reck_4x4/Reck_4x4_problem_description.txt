Problem Description-Reck_4x4:

Design a NxN Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) mesh utilizing the Reck method. The circuit should utilize Nx(N-1)/2 built-in MZI components arranged in a triangular network format to from a reconfigurable optical network capable of perfoming any unitary transformation on N input channels. Each MZI should incorporate adjustable phase shifters to control the interference and routing of optical signals within the mesh. Use a built-in components called mzi_ps to represent the MZI block incorporate adjustable phase shifters. 

Parameters:N=4
