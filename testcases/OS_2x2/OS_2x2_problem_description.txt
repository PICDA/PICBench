Problem Description-OS_2x2:

Design a 2x2 optical switch using built-in coupler components and phase shifters. By incorporating built-in multimode interferometer (MMI) components and 4 adjustable phase shifters, the switch should be able to alternate between the cross and bar states, effectively controlling the switching operation.
