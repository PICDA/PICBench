Problem Description-64-QAM modulator:

Design an optical 64-QAM transmitter using dual drive Mach-Zehnder Modulators (MZMs) in a parallel configuration to encode 6 bits per symbol simultaneously. The modulator should have only one input and one output. The input will be split into the parallel MZMs, each responsible for modulating two of the binary bits into corresponding optical phase states, with the appropriate phase shift applied to create the desired quadrature phase modulation. The output of the modulating arms will be combined to produce the final 64-QAM signal, which varies both in amplitude and phase for each symbol transition. Use the built-in multimode interferometer (MMI) component for splitting and combining the optical signals, and a built-in component called mzm_dual to represent the dual drive Mach-Zehnder modulators.
