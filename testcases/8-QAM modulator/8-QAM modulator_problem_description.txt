Problem Description-8-QAM modulator:

Design an optical 8-QAM transmitter using single drive Mach-Zehnder Modulators (MZMs) in a parallel configuration to encode 3 bits per symbol simultaneously. The modulator should have only one input and one output. The input will be split into the parallel MZMs, each responsible for modulating one of the binary bits into corresponding optical phase states, with the appropriate phase shift applied to create the desired quadrature phase modulation. The output of the modulating arms will be combined to produce the final 8-QAM signal, which varies both in amplitude and phase for each symbol transition. Use the built-in multimode interferometer (MMI) component for splitting and combining the optical signals, and a built-in component called mzm to represent the single drive Mach-Zehnder modulators.
